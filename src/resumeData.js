    "aboutme":"I grew up knowing that I would go into some STEM field, but it wasn't until high school that I discovered my love of mathematics and computer science. My high school didn't offer any computer science classes so I began teaching myself C++, by the time I started my journey at Pennsylvania State University in 2020, I was familiar with C++, Java, and Python and I had already started making some small projects. I am always looking to learn more about this rich and deep field of science and push myself to acheive more everyday",
